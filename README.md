Analysis of Current Clinical Trials on Cancer Immunotherapies.

This repository contains code and notebooks developed to analyze the competitive landscape of ongoing clinical trials in cancer immunotherapy. The data is sourced from publicly available registries, specifically ClinicalTrials.gov and EudraCT, which have been downloaded and preprocessed.

- analysis.ipynb: merges and harmonizes the data from both sources, and performs descriptive analyses to characterize the trials. This includes trial counts, distribution by condition, intervention types, sponsors, collaborators, and other key features to understand the current competitive landscape in this space.

- analysis2.ipynb (in progress): will expand on the first notebook by applying data science methods to identify which trials may have the highest likelihood of progressing successfully.

The objective is to build an actionable and up-to-date overview of the immuno-oncology clinical trial ecosystem, providing insights to inform future strategic or research decisions.
